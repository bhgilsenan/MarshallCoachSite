REPLIT PROMPT — FOUNDATIONAL ADJUSTMENTS ONLY (ACTIONABLE)

IMPORTANT: FOLLOW THESE RULES EXACTLY

This task is strictly limited to numeric and dimensional adjustments.

DO NOT change:

colors

fonts or font families

font weights, casing, or letter spacing

border radii

shadows, elevation, or motion

hover, focus, or active styles

component structure, variants, or class names

overall visual styling or brand expression

The UI must look identical in style after this task.

If a change is not strictly numeric (size, spacing, height, padding), do not make it.

ACTIONABLE PUNCH LIST (DO THESE EXACTLY)
1. Typography — size hierarchy only

Without altering any existing typography styling:

Ensure H1 > H2 > H3 > body in font size

Apply the following font sizes only:

H1: 48px

H2: 36px

H3: 24px

Body text: 16px

Small/helper text: 14px

Apply responsive scaling:

On mobile:

H1 → 36px

H2 → 28px

Do not change:

weights

uppercase usage

tracking

line-height unless text becomes unreadable

2. Buttons — dimensions only

Keep all button styling unchanged.

Standardize button dimensions to:

Primary buttons: height 44px, horizontal padding 20px

Secondary buttons: height 40px, horizontal padding 16px

Tertiary / nav buttons: height 32px, horizontal padding 8px

Adjust font-size only if necessary to prevent text wrapping.

Do not alter:

colors

border radius

shadows

hover or active behavior

3. Spacing — vertical rhythm only

Normalize vertical spacing without changing layout structure:

Section vertical padding:

Desktop: 80px

Mobile: 48px

Vertical spacing between stacked elements:

Tight: 8px

Normal: 16px

Loose: 24px

Do not:

change horizontal spacing

rewrap content

modify grid or alignment

4. Forms — size consistency only

Keep all visual styling intact.

Standardize:

Input height: 44px

Adjust label and helper text size only if inconsistent, using:

Labels: 14–16px

Helper/error text: 12–14px

Do not change focus styles or borders.

IMPLEMENTATION RULES

Apply changes incrementally, starting with:

Buttons

Typography

Spacing

Forms

Do not refactor, clean up, or rename code.

Make the minimum number of changes required to satisfy each item.

If uncertain, leave existing styling unchanged.

SUCCESS CRITERIA

Visual personality is unchanged

Only sizes, spacing, and hierarchy consistency are improved

No components look redesigned

No new abstractions are introduced
