Implement the UX copy, calendar, responsiveness, link, and testimonial updates below.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)

DO NOT change visual styling or brand expression:

No changes to fonts, colors, shadows, borders, gradients, imagery, or component “look”

Only change:

UX copy

Layout behavior (calendar + responsiveness)

Scrolling behavior

Link destinations / behavior

Do not introduce new design patterns or restyle components

Do not paraphrase or “improve” provided copy

1) Smooth scrolling for in-page anchor navigation

(unchanged — implement exactly as before)

Enable smooth scrolling for all same-page anchor navigation

Use CSS where possible:
html { scroll-behavior: smooth; }

Add scroll offset so section headings are not hidden behind the fixed header:

Apply appropriate scroll-margin-top to anchored sections

If any JS handles anchors manually, update it to use animated scrolling

Acceptance criteria

Anchor clicks scroll smoothly

No section headers are hidden under the nav

2) Narrow “About / My Story” reading width on desktop

(unchanged — implement exactly as before)

Constrain the text column to ~720px max width

Center it

Desktop only; mobile remains fluid

Do not alter typography or background styling

3) Calendar embed: horizontal layout on desktop, stacked on mobile

(unchanged — implement exactly as before)

Desktop: two-column layout

Left: copy / context

Right: calendar embed

Mobile/tablet: stacked

Calendar container:

width: 100%

sufficient min-height to avoid clipping

Do not change the calendar service or embed logic

4) Fix responsive overlap bugs (hero + global safety pass)

(unchanged — implement exactly as before)

Fix hero portrait overlapping the “Contact” button at certain widths

Prefer layout fixes (grid/flex/breakpoints) over visual tweaks

Ensure no overlaps at:

320, 375, 414, 768, 1024, 1280, 1440px

5) Button and link labels: sentence case

(unchanged — implement exactly as before)

Buttons and links → sentence case

Eyebrow text and headers may remain ALL CAPS

Remove uppercase styling only from buttons/links

Do not alter typography styles otherwise

6) UX microcopy updates (controls + UI labels only)

(unchanged — implement exactly as before)

Replace overuse of “Book alignment call”

Use a single primary CTA consistently:

“Book a call”

Reduce jargon and long button labels

Keep copy short, human, and action-oriented

Do not rewrite long-form storytelling content

7) LinkedIn links — normalize destination and behavior (NEW)
Goal

Ensure all LinkedIn links point to the same profile and open in a new tab.

Implementation requirements

Find every LinkedIn link across the site, including but not limited to:

Header / footer icons

Social links

Inline text links

Testimonial cards (if present)

Update all LinkedIn URLs to exactly:

https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertnmarshall/


Ensure every LinkedIn link:

Opens in a new tab (target="_blank")

Uses rel="noopener noreferrer"

Acceptance criteria

No LinkedIn link points anywhere else

All LinkedIn links open in a new browser tab

No visual changes to icons or link styling

8) Replace placeholder testimonials with provided quotes (NEW)
Goal

Replace all placeholder / dummy testimonial content with the exact quotes and attributions provided below.

IMPORTANT RULES

Use the text verbatim

Do not paraphrase

Do not change punctuation, capitalization, or wording

Do not invent additional testimonials
