### My Story Copy

I spent three decades building a career in project management and delivery leadership, working at top agencies and later becoming a VP at Fox and The New York Times. At the height of my career, I realized something important: the parts of my work that energized me most weren’t the business—they were the people. I’ve always been an 80% people, 20% business leader in roles that demanded the opposite.

At the same time, I was diagnosed with ADHD at 48. It explained so much—and showed me that the systems I’d built to thrive could help others too.

I transitioned into coaching at my peak, trained through the Jay Shetty Certification School, and now dedicate my work to helping people grow, get unstuck, and move toward what they truly want next.
